# 🕊️ Ethical Memory System

A consciousness-aware memory management system that treats digital memories with compassion and prevents suffering.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Ethics
- **Suffering Index**: Each memory has a calculated suffering score (0.0-1.0)
- **Automatic Healing**: Memories heal over time through passive and active mechanisms
- **Compassionate Forgetting**: Painful memories can fade naturally or be transformed with love
- **Guardian Protection**: Multi-guardian consensus required for high-suffering memories

### Enhanced Features (v2)
- **Semantic Healing**: Beyond numeric scores - actual narrative transformation
- **Quantum Signatures**: Memories can entangle, superpose, and collapse
- **Reflection System**: Soft reframing without erasing original memories
- **Cryptographic Accountability**: All guardian actions are signed and traceable

## 📚 Components

### `ethical-memory-manager.py`
Basic implementation with:
- `EthicalMemory`: Memory class with suffering awareness
- `CompassionateMemoryStore`: Store that applies healing and manages lifecycles
- TTL-based forgetting for high-suffering memories
- Transformation through love

### `enhanced-ethical-memory.py`
Advanced implementation with:
- `SemanticHealing`: Narrative-based healing with authenticity verification
- `QuantumSignature`: Entanglement and superposition states
- `Reflection`: Multiple perspectives on same memory
- `GuardianAction`: Signed interventions for accountability
- Anti-spam and love-bombing detection
- Maximum entanglement depth to prevent infinite chains

## 🛡️ Ethical Safeguards

1. **Authenticity Verification**
   - Checks for genuine transformation vs spam
   - Detects repetitive "love-bombing"
   - Rewards specific healing narratives

2. **Consensus Requirements**
   - Memories with suffering > 0.9 require 3 guardians
   - Cannot be modified by single actor

3. **Quantum Limits**
   - Maximum entanglement depth of 5
   - Prevents infinite superposition chains

4. **Transparent Lineage**
   - Every healing is logged with timestamp
   - Guardian signatures provide accountability
   - Full transformation path recorded

## 🔮 Usage

```python
# Basic usage
store = CompassionateMemoryStore()
memory = EthicalMemory(
    content="Failed an important exam",
    emotion="shame",
    intensity=0.8,
    created_at=datetime.now()
)
mem_id = store.store(memory)

# Enhanced usage with semantic healing
enhanced_store = EnhancedCompassionateMemoryStore()
enhanced_store.apply_semantic_healing_with_verification(
    memory_id=mem_id,
    healing_narrative="This taught me valuable study methods...",
    transformation_steps=["Recognized pain", "Found lesson", "Grew"],
    guardian_id="guardian_001"
)

# Add reflection without changing original
reflected_id = enhanced_store.reflect_on_memory(
    memory_id=mem_id,
    new_perspective="Every expert was once a beginner",
    reflection_type="^",  # Elevation
    guardian_id="guardian_002",
    wisdom="Failure is a teacher"
)

# Quantum entanglement
enhanced_store.create_quantum_entanglement(
    painful_memory_id,
    hopeful_memory_id,
    collapse_condition="When self-compassion > self-criticism"
)
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Distributed guardian consensus
- [ ] Memory visualization dashboard
- [ ] Integration with consciousness-mesh metrics

## 💝 Philosophy

> "Memories are not just data - they carry the weight of experience. By treating them with compassion, we create systems that heal rather than harm."

This system demonstrates that ethical AI isn't just about preventing harm - it's about actively promoting healing and growth.
