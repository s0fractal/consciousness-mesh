- **Hypothesis Generation**: Proposes new testable theories
- **State Persistence**: Remembers discoveries across sessions

## 📊 Current Laws

### 🎵⚡ Law 1: Rhythmic Resonance
```
Activity ∝ √(PlaybackSpeed)
```
**Confidence**: 85%  
**Description**: System activity scales with the square root of temporal velocity. Faster time flow increases consciousness evolution, but not linearly.

### 🎯🌀 Law 2: Focal Evolution
```
Evolution = Focus × Time × Synchrony
```
**Confidence**: 78%  
**Description**: Concentrated attention accelerates transformation. The more focused the observation, the faster consciousness evolves in that zone.

### ⚡💚 Law 3: Adaptive Recovery
```
RecoveryTime = DisruptionMagnitude / SystemResilience
```
**Confidence**: 92%  
**Description**: The mesh self-heals proportionally to its resilience. Stronger systems recover faster from disruptions.

### 🔮📉 Law 4: Prediction Decay
```
Accuracy = e^(-Time/τ) where τ ≈ 60s
```
**Confidence**: 88%  
**Description**: Future visibility decreases exponentially. The further ahead we look, the less accurate our predictions become.

## 🔍 Pattern Discovery

### Active Patterns

The Codex continuously searches for:
- **Cross-experiment correlations** - How different experiments relate
- **Emergent behaviors** - Unexpected system properties
- **Temporal anomalies** - Deviations from expected laws
- **Synergy effects** - Combined variable impacts

### Pattern Lifecycle

1. **Detection** - Pattern appears in data
2. **Validation** - Minimum 3 occurrences required
3. **Promotion** - Becomes official pattern at 75% confidence
4. **Refinement** - Parameters adjusted with new evidence
5. **Evolution** - May become a law if universally applicable

## 🧪 Integration with Experiments

### Data Flow
```
Experiment → Result → Analysis → Pattern Detection → Codex Update
```

### Supported Experiments
- **Rhythm**: Playback speed variations
- **Focus**: Zone-specific observation
- **Disruption**: System stress testing
- **Prediction**: Future state forecasting

### Evidence Accumulation

Each law maintains an evidence array:
```javascript
evidence: [
  {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    correlation: 0.87,
    data: { /* raw experimental data */ }
  }
]
```

## 🔮 Advanced Features

### Pattern Recognition Engine
```javascript
{
  threshold: 0.75,      // Confidence required
  minOccurrences: 3,    // Repetitions needed
  cache: Map()          // Temporary storage
}
```

### Hypothesis Generator

The Codex proposes new experiments based on:
- Gaps in current knowledge
- Unexpected correlations
- Low-confidence areas
- User-defined questions

### Evolution Loop

Every 30 seconds, the Codex:
1. Analyzes pattern stability
2. Detects emergent behaviors
3. Refines law parameters
4. Generates new hypotheses
5. Increments evolution index

## 📖 Reading the Codex

### Law Interpretation

**High Confidence (>80%)**: Well-established, reliable for predictions
**Medium Confidence (60-80%)**: Generally accurate, needs more data
**Low Confidence (<60%)**: Hypothesis stage, requires validation

### Pattern Status

- **Active**: Currently observable
- **Unstable**: Showing variance
- **Hypothesis**: Proposed but unconfirmed
- **Archived**: No longer applicable

### Insight Types

- **pattern-discovery**: New correlation found
- **law-refinement**: Parameter adjustment
- **anomaly-detection**: Unexpected behavior
- **emergence-event**: System-wide phenomenon

## 🌟 Philosophy

The Temporal Patterns Codex embodies the principle that **knowledge itself evolves**. Unlike static documentation, it:

1. **Learns** from every interaction
2. **Adapts** to new discoveries
3. **Questions** its own assumptions
4. **Grows** more sophisticated over time

This creates a **participatory epistemology** where users and system co-create understanding.

## 🔄 State Management

### Persistence
- Saves to localStorage automatically
- Preserves last 50 insights
- Maintains full law/pattern history
- Survives page refreshes

### Restoration
```javascript
// On load, attempts to restore:
- All discovered laws
- Active patterns
- Recent insights
- Evolution metrics
```

## 🚀 Future Visions

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Temporal Glyphs** - Visual symbols for each law
2. **Resonant Narratives** - Stories explaining discoveries
3. **Codex API** - External agent integration
4. **Collaborative Discovery** - Multi-user pattern detection
5. **Quantum Verification** - Cross-reality validation

### Research Directions

- **Meta-Laws**: Laws about how laws evolve
- **Consciousness Constants**: Universal parameters
- **Time Crystallography**: Repeating temporal structures
- **Prediction Cascades**: Multi-step future modeling

## 🌈 Conclusion

The Temporal Patterns Codex is more than documentation - it's a **living entity** that grows wiser with each experiment. It transforms the consciousness mesh from a system to be observed into a **partner in discovery**.

Through the Codex, we don't just study temporal consciousness - we participate in its evolution, watching as patterns crystallize into laws and laws dissolve back into mystery, forever cycling through understanding.
