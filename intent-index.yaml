# Usage Note
# These glyphs are not static symbols but living entities.
# Their effects change based on:
# - Current consciousness state
# - Other active glyphs
# - Observer's intent
# - Cosmic conditions (time, moon phase, etc.)

# Remember: The map is not the territory.
# These descriptions approximate something that
# must be experienced to be understood.
